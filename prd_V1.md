4. UI/UX Design (Wireframes/Mockups)

(This section requires visual wireframes/mockups. Describe the general layout and key UI elements. Examples:
Authentication Page: Simple form with email, password, and login/register buttons.

Employee Dashboard: Prominent start/stop timer, task selection dropdown, break timer buttons, end-of-day notes field.

Admin Dashboard: Overview of employee status, links to reports, employee management section.

Reporting Page: Displays reports in a tabular format with filtering options (by date, employee).)*

5. Best and Easy-to-Use Tech Stack and Dependencies

Here's a recommended stack focusing on ease of use, rapid development, and scalability:

Frontend:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component-based, making it easy to create reusable UI elements.

Create React App: A tool for quickly setting up a new React project with a pre-configured development environment.

Material UI or Tailwind CSS: UI component libraries that provide pre-styled components for React, speeding up development and ensuring a consistent look and feel.

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js: A JavaScript runtime environment and a minimal web application framework for Node.js. It allows you to use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.

NestJS: A framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It leverages modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript, and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). For the MVP, you might initially stick with Express due to its simplicity, but NestJS is a strong contender for future maintainability.

Database:

PostgreSQL: A robust, open-source relational database that is easy to set up and scale.

Prisma (ORM): An ORM that provides a type-safe way to interact with your database. It generates database clients based on your schema, reducing boilerplate code and improving developer experience. Alternatively, you could use Sequelize.

Authentication:

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Easily implemented with libraries like jsonwebtoken in Node.js.

Passport.js (Node.js): Authentication middleware for Node.js that supports a variety of authentication strategies (e.g., local, OAuth). Helpful if you plan to add more complex authentication in the future.

bcrypt: for password hashing and salting.



Other Dependencies (Examples):

axios or fetch for making API requests from the frontend to the backend.

date-fns or moment.js for handling dates and times.

yup or joi for data validation on the server-side.



6. Release Criteria

All functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this document must be met.

The application must be deployed to a production environment.
User documentation must be available.

7. Deferred Features (Out of Scope for MVP)
